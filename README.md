crib-dragger
============

Drag a guessed crib across two sets of bytes that were both encrypted with the same one-time pad.

Simply modify the crib string to contain your guess, then run the code. If your guess was part of either message,
you'll see the plain-text of the other message.

For extra fun, modify the key and messages:
  This could be adapted into a game by randomising the messages with dictionary words.
  The key can be totally random.
